## 5. Tools

1. *Development environments*
    - Adoption of a specific development environment will not be mandated at the company level.  Individuals are free to use their tool of choice unless specific Teams or Projects mandate a particular tool at the Team or Project level.
    - In the absence of any other personal/Team/Project preference, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended as it is used fairly widely across the different Teams.
    - All repo readmes should specify how to develop the project using at least one IDE, including instructions for accessing documentation, building and running from within the chose IDE.

2. *Default technologies* [Thien]  
    a. REST server - fastAPI (python)  
         - Adopt FastAPI as preferred Python default; no default in other languages  
    b. WebApp - Svelte & MaterialUI  
        - There are examples in QB using Svelte (Frontend hire may have own preference)  
    c. UIs ???  
        - There are examples in QB using PythonWX (diamond characterisation; FE hire may have own prefs)  
    d. Test frameworks  
        - gtest for C++ tests  
        - pytest for Python tests  
        - CI tests to be run using Gitlab CI
