## 5. Tools

    1. development environments -- what to support, to what extent do we need a canonical one? [Pat]
        - Project readmes should specify how to develop the project using (at least) one IDE.

    2. “Default” technologies: [Thien]
        a. REST server - fastAPI (python)
            - Adopt FastAPI as preferred Python default; no default in other languages
        b. WebApp - Svelte & MaterialUI
            - There are examples in QB using Svelte (Frontend hire may have own preference)
        c. UIs ???
            - There are examples in QB using PythonWX (diamond characterisation; FE hire may have own prefs)
        d. Test frameworks
            - gtest for C++ tests
            - pytest for Python tests
            - CI tests to be run using Gitlab CI
