Describe the intent of your changes as well as describing what changes were made. Including the intent will help reviewers point out where you stray from the original intent. Make note of any omissions or reasons why something was done a particular way (if it helps reviewers understand, though arguably this should be in comments in the code).

## Reviewer instructions

Describe what you want from this review. You can use `@name` to give different reviewers different roles. For example, you might get one person to ensure it fits with the architecture of the rest of the software, another to check the accuracy of the calculations, and have others on the MR as an observer so they can keep abrest of the status of the change that may soon be affecting them.
