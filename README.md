# Quantum Brilliance Software Development Handbook

1. **This Handbook**

    This document details the standardised software engineering and development practices employed at Quantum Brilliance (QB).  It originally arose from discussion and debate within the QB Coding Practices Taskforce, a community-led forum incorporating all teams in QB involved in writing software.  

    1. *Scope*  
    This Handbook is intended to apply to everything that looks like software within QB.  Although that includes even laboratory notebooks, it is recognised that not all of the following guidelines are necessarily appropriate in that particular context.  Lab notebook authors are encouraged to adopt as many as possible on a best-effort basis.  Work with external partners is also not necessarily covered by these guidelines, given the potential for additional external constraints; QB staff are encouraged to apply these guidelines to such work only as far as practically possible.

    2. *Adoption and enforcement*  
    Team Leads and other developers are expected to encourage their colleagues to follow the policies detailed in this Handbook.  The policies are to be enforced in code reviews, assessement of merge requests, and in continuous integration (CI) tests.  

    3. *Format, location and modification*  
    The Handbook exists in [a repository on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/qbau/company-wide/software-development-handbook) as a series of markdown files, with a simple [wiki overlay](https://gitlab.com/qbau/company-wide/software-development-handbook/-/wikis/Quantum-Brilliance-Software-Development-Handbook) that redirects back to the online repo view of the markdown documents.  The main branch of the repository is considered the current reference policy set.  The Handbook can be updated or added to by submitting a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/qbau/company-wide/software-development-handbook/-/merge_requests/new) to the repository for review.  Changes that significantly update or modify the policies contained herein should be ratified by discussion within the Coding Practices Taskforce before they are accepted for merge into the main branch.
