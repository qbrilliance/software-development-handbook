1. Preamble covering:

    1. scope
        - intended to apply to everything that looks like software within QB
            - (Lab notebooks should follow where appropriate, but not everything)
        - work with external partners not necessarily covered by this

    2. adoption/enforcement/legitimacy
        - enforced in code / merge reviews
        - in CI tests
        - by team leads within group practices

    3. format + location
        - To be placed on GitLab as markdown files, with a wiki that directs to them
        - To be displayed prettily on readthedocs after round 1 converges
